Hi all! My name is TJ and welcome to the WebDev Journey blog. I currently work as a technical writer for a biotech company and whilst I love writing, I also want to branch out into web development. So here I am! The step to blogging seems like a natural progression for a tech writer as I have been wanting to experiment with different styles of writing. 

In terms of the web development, I studied a bit at university and then proceeded to do very little with those skills. This blog will be about my journey as I step back into the world of web development. It is primarly for my own practice and keeping myself accountable, but I hope that there is some content that will help someone else too. 

In my spare time I read, play video games, and can often be found being taken on a walk by my dog.
