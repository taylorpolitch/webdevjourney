Hello, World!

Welcome to WeDev Journey where I (TJ) will be keeping track of my progress whilst learning new web development skills.  

I currently work as a technical writer at a biotech company where we work with scientists to solve solving food security and biodiversity issues around the world. It's very niche, I know! And I feel tremendously lucky to work in that field but I am always looking to improve my own skills in other areas too.

Whilst my main role is to write instructional content for our users and maintain internal documentation, I am also exposed to many other tasks such as:

* Using static site generators such as Sphinx to generate flat-file websites 
* HTML and CSS for styling these sites
* UI design for Android apps that we also create
* Exploratory software testing
* Graphic design of icons
* Instructional Youtube videos 

I love writing but I have also found that some of these other tasks give me a great sense of accomplishment which is what has piqued my interest in web development. 

Over the years I have studied small amounts of coding, from Visual Basic in high school, to Java at university, and Python in my own time. The problem is that I have always set my goals and expectations so high that I quickly realise they are unavailable and give up. 

The difference now is that the web dev skills I have been learning have become practical, and this has created a massive shift in motivation. I'm not looking at web development as a monolithic obstacle to be conquered anymore. As I've overcome small hurdles, the monolith has started to look more like many bricks of tools, components, and systems that can be stacked upon one another to form something cohesive. 

Whilst I am not an absolute beginner, I want to 'start fresh' and record my journey to keep track of my learning, keep myself accountable, and use this website to store my coding challanges. These are my goals for the blog:

* Become a web developer to add skills to my existing skillset
* Improve my writing in a style that is very different from documentation
* Help any other new developers or writers with getting started in tech

Some of the content that I plan to put out in the first couple of months is:

* Explanations of some of the tools that I have chosen to make this site
* What webdev courses and learning I am doing
* Posting coding challenges from my courses
* Instructional content
* Tech writing 

Thanks for stopping by, and make sure to keep an eye out as I will be posting some new content really soon.

TJ
